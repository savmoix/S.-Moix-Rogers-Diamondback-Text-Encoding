        <div type="editorial"><p>How dare you <desc type="race">black</desc>students of the
<orgName ref="#UMD">University</orgName> complain?</p>
           <p>I think it's perfectly asinine <choice><orig>ofyou</orig><reg>of you</reg></choice>
             <ref type="identify hegemonic reference with some sort of #?">people</ref> to think you can get something
for nothing. Furthermore, I think
you've been given enough already.</p>
<p>After all, there isn<add>'</add>t a <desc type="race">white</desc> student
union on campus <add>--</add> neither would it
have been permitted.</p>
<p>Look at all the money <orgName ref="#SGA"><abbr>SGA</abbr></orgName> appro<lb break="yes"/>
priated you just because you<add>'</add>re <desc type="race">black</desc>.
  Let<add>'</add>s face it. You <choice><orig><ref type="#slur">niggers</ref</desc></orig><reg>n-word</reg></choice> get all the
breaks. When there's an opening in
the dining halls or the janitorial
  staff, who gets the job? A <desc type="black people">nigger</desc>.</p>
           <p>Look at <ref type="link to specific riots? newspaper articles">the riots</ref>. You <desc type="black people">niggers</desc>
damned near robbed my brother-in<lb break="yes"/>
law blind. Now he can<add>'</add>t even get
the insurance company to pay off.
Violence isn<add>'</add>t the answer especially
             when it<add>'</add> !--- incorporate misidentification of "communist" as slur, interchangeable with slurs ---! <affiliation><desc type="black">communist</desc></affiliation> inspired.</p>
<p>What if !--- way to pronoun tag? use ref tags ---! we <desc type="race">whites</desc> had armed our<lb break="yes"/>
selves and looted <desc type="race">black</desc> businesses?
  You claim that the <affiliation><desc type="race">black</desc> student
  population</affiliation> isn<add>'</add>t representative of
  <affiliation><desc type="race">black</desc> population</affiliation> on a whole.</p>
<p>Can we help it if <choice><orig><ref type="#slur">niggers</ref</desc></orig><reg>n-word</reg></choice> don<add>'</add>t want
to come here? Besides, nobody had
to tell me to come here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you have to accept
the fact that the <desc type="race">black students</desc> aren<add>'</add>t
as intelligent as <desc type="race">whites</desc> and therefore
won't do as well in college.</p>
<p>You think you have it bad. Look at
  the <desc type="ethnic groups">Jews, the Irish, the Italians</desc>. They
made it, didn<add>'</add>t they? Why can<add>'</add>t you
people stop making bad scenes?</p>
<p>Don<add>'</add>t your leaders have any con<lb break="yes"/>
  trol over you <desc type="black people / slur?">savages</desc>? The display
of violence in the <orgName ref="#SGA"><abbr>SGA</abbr></orgName> budget hearing
was simply disgraceful. You say you
don<add>'</add>t want tokenism but you were
  willing to accept only <num>two</num> <affiliation><desc type="race">black</desc> mem<lb break="yes"/>
bers on the cheer leading squad</affiliation>.</p>
<p>Why not the whole squad? You also
showed extreme lack of respect for
  our great !--- way to indicicate a title for a person? way to link to his profile/bio?---! President <surname>Elkins</surname>. Hasn<add>'</add>t
he established an effective enough
line of communication between you
and his administration?</p>
<p>If not, why don<add>'</add>t you tell him so?
There<add>'</add>s a proper way to get results
at the <orgName ref="#UMD">University</orgName>.</p>
